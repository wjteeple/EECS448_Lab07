Observations

1. No clear way to check results of isEmpty. False output may result from incorrect size comparison  	or constant false in return statement
2. When a linked list is initialized, the default value for m_size is not 0 for an empty list
3. AddBack increments correctly, but the value is not being added correctly. Value, override, but    	cannot verify if node is actually added to the back
4. Mimiced testing for addFront. Incrementing and adding is done correctly
5. RemoveBack fails, but only as a result of AddBack being incorrect
6. Using AddFront instead, RemoveBack seems to remove the node successfully
7. RemoveFront fails. Since all tests passed addFront, we can assume that removeFront is incorrect


Bug Guesses

1. Potential error in isEmpty(), but source cannot be verified
2. m_size is not properly initialized when a linked list is constructed
3. addBack() does not properly add a node to the list, value in the node is not correct
4. removeFront() does not properly remove a node from the front of the list
